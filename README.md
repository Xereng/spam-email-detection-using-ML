Absolutely! Here's a simple and clear **GitHub README** you can use for your spam email classification project:

# 📧 Spam Email Classifier

This is a simple **Spam Email Classifier Web App** built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Scikit-learn**.

It predicts whether a message is **SPAM** or **HAM** (not spam) using a **Naive Bayes machine learning model**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Simple and interactive web interface
* Real-time prediction of spam or ham messages
* Built with machine learning using a real email dataset

---

## 🛠️ Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - for building the web app
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - for machine learning
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - for data handling

---

## 📂 Dataset

The app uses a JSON file `email-text-data.json` that contains:

* `MESSAGE`: the email or message text
* `CATEGORY`: the label (`spam` or `ham`)

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "MESSAGE": "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card. Click here.",
    "CATEGORY": "spam"
  },
  {
    "MESSAGE": "Let's have a meeting at 10 am tomorrow.",
    "CATEGORY": "ham"
  }
]
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The dataset is loaded and the text is converted into numbers using `CountVectorizer`.
2. A **Naive Bayes classifier** is trained to recognize spam patterns.
3. The user enters a message into the app.
4. The model predicts whether the message is spam or not and shows the result.

## ▶️ How to Run the App

1. **Clone this repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-classifier.git
   cd spam-email-classifier
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open in your browser** (usually opens automatically):
   `http://localhost:8501`
